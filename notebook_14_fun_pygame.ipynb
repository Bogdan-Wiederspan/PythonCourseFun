    "Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to learn the basics of pygame and create a simple game called [\"Breakout\"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(Computerspiel)). This game was created by Atari Inc. and introduced on May 13, 1976. It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, influenced by the 1972 Atari arcade game Pong, and built by Steve Wozniak.\n",

    "import pygame\n",
    "# you can also init things like the font module alone pygame.font.init()\n",
    "pygame.init()\n",

    "# set up the drawing window\n",
    "HEIGHT, WIDTH = 500, 500\n",
    "# create the windows and diplay it\n",
    "screen = pygame.display.set_mode([HEIGHT, WIDTH])\n",
    "# set the window name\n",
    "pygame.display.set_caption(\"Break Out\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is also a good idea to define some global CONSTANTS for the game, like colors you want to use or screen dimensions, or global scores and so on. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# color codes we intend to use\n",
    "WHITE = (255, 255, 255)\n",
