    "In this notebook we want to have some fun and create a game.\n",

    "The documentation can be found [here](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).\n",

    "Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are very limited in the time we have to create a game from much simpler times in this case from teh ATARI 2600 era.\n",
    "This game is \"Breakout\". This game was created by Atari Inc. and introduced on May 13, 1976. It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, influenced by the 1972 Atari arcade game Pong, and built by Steve Wozniak. The Wikipedia article can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)), the historical aspect is actualy quiet interesting.\n",

    "1. Initialization: This is the part where you set up the game, load images, set the game window and set up global variables.\n",
    "2. Game loop: This is the hearth of your game, where you update the game state and draw the game state to the screen.\n",
    "   - You also handle game logic in this part like collision detection, scoring, etc.\n",
    "   - You also handle event handling, like user input.\n",

    "### The game loop:\n",
    "#### Fonts\n",
    "First of all we want to hae a score and a number of lives [font](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/font.html).\n",
    "You can bring a text to the screen using ´pygame.font.Font´and `font.render`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collision with paddle and bricks\n",
    "Since paddle and bricks are instances of objects we can check the collision in the game loop, since they are accessable. The ball has a collision method to check if it collides with another object. We can utilize this. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the ball collides with the paddle, the ball should bounce back. \n",
    "Also it would be cool to increase the speed slightly to make the game harder. \n",
    "You can do this by multiplying the speed with a factor, try to also set a max speed.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if ball.collide(paddle):\n",
    "        # adjust direction\n",
    "        # adjust speed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The collision with the bricks are more complicated. \n",
    "If the ball collides with a brick, the brick should be destroyed and the score should be increased, and the ball also should bounce back. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to iterate over all bricks and check if the ball collides with them. \n",
    "We also need to replace the brick with an empty brick, or destroy a brick object if it is hit, by pop it from the list of bricks. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # ball and wall\n",
    "    for num_brick, brick in enumerate(bricks):\n",
    "        brick.draw()\n",
    "        if ball.collide(brick):\n",
    "            # increase score\n",

    "            # adjust win condition\n",

    "            # replace the brick with an empty brick that has the same position\n",
    "            # remove the brick from bricks\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # reverse the direction of the ball and increase speed\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Win and lose condition\n",
    "We win if no bricks are left. \n",
    "Rather then counting the number of bricks within the list, we can just use a counter that increases\n",
    "and decreases everytime we adjusts `bricks`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if num_of_bricks == 0:\n",
    "    # display win message\n",
    "    # set game loop variable to False\n",

    "We want to give him some time to prepare mentally for the next round. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# when outside:\n",
    "    # loose a life\n",
    "    # reset ball position\n",
    "    # pause the game until press p\n",
    "    while pause:\n",
    "        # display message\n",
    "        # check for key press\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we have no lives left, we loose the game. \n",
    "We simply display a game over message and wait for the user to close the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sound and music\n",
    "To make the game more fun we can add sound and music. \n",
    "You have some sound files in the `sounds` folder. \n",
    "Sound effect and music are handled different, but both needs to be loaded before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For music you can use `pygame.mixer.music.load` and `pygame.mixer.music.play`.\n",
    "No variable is created to store the music, so you can adjust the volume with `pygame.mixer.music.set_volume`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# set up music and sound effects\n",
    "sound_folder = './sounds'\n",
    "pygame.mixer.music.load(f'{sound_folder}/stage.mp3')\n",
    "# -1 = play the music in a loop, 0 = start at the beginning\n",
    "pygame.mixer.music.play(-1, 0)\n",
    "# set the volume of the music, trust me its loud\n",
    "pygame.mixer.music.set_volume(0.2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sound effects are loaded with `pygame.mixer.Sound`.\n",
    "You store the effects in a variable which is then called. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "sfx_hit_brick = pygame.mixer.Sound(f'{sound_folder}/brick_hit.wav')\n",
    "sfx_hit_brick.set_volume(0.05)\n",
    "sfx_death = pygame.mixer.Sound(f'{sound_folder}/death.wav')\n",
    "sfx_death.set_volume(0.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To play the sound effect you can use `play` on the variable.\n",
    "```python\n",
