# PythonCourseFun
At the last day of the "Python Course" at the UHH I had time for something more fun. 
Many students showed interested in doing games programming. 
So, I created this small repo as a template to guide the students.

We program the game "BreakOut" from the ATARI console. 

To start the game pygame is required. 
To install write `pip install pygame --user`.
To run the game write `python3 solution/break_out.py` from the ROOT directory.
